# ccct
Communicative Cipher Crypto Tool (tool for sckrd demo)

## Description
This Tool is only for demonstration purposes.
You are able to encrypt files and generate crypto keys which are printed to stdout.
The same key you can use to decrypt the file again or you can insert them into a binary file.
This binary file can be analysed by sckrd (https://github.com/scisa/sckrd) to check if it finds the generated key or to show that it does.
